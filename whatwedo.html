        <h1>OUR <span>INITIATIVES</span>:</h1>
        <p>As stated before, this campaign begun to encourage more women to freely express themselves through sports and fitness to
            combat the discrimination that women are faced with. The campaign was quite diverse and extended to a number of women around the world.
            <br>
            <br>This campaign came with 3 MORE campaigns in the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, as stated in the previous page. And these
            3 campaigns were all based on hyperlocal strategies stemming from local perceptions. Their markets had an impact and this even lead to debates on
            women in sports.
            <br>
            <br>NIKE, along with it's participants has still been taking stands up until now against societal issues. The continuous initiative 
            and call-to-action that NIKE has allows them to advance and make bigger impacts on the world.

        <h1><span>Involvements?</span></h1>
        <p>This campaign was created, produced, and launched by NIKE themselves with the help of the advertising agency Wieden + Kennedy.
            There is no public information that can be found as to who exactly are involved in the campaign, however, this campaign features
            popular celebrities including Serena Williams, Virgil Abloh, and many more.
            <br>There is also no sources that claims that the government was directly involved in this campaign. For all we know, this has been 
            criticized due to it's political connotations and because of the ads implying a political-related position on some issues.
