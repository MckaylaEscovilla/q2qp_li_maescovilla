            <img src="../images/believe.jpg">
            <p>For a long time, various people have criticized certain corporations for their practices, polices, and etc; NIKE was no exception. 
                However, recently, NIKE did attract the attention of many campaigns about social justice. One in particular, the “Believe in More” campaign in 2018, confronted women inequality 
                around the world.
                <br>Other than their shoe brand, NIKE is known for taking a stance against many societal issues. NIKE noticed the need for women to gain courage
                and embrace sporting in their lives.
                <br>Countless women are still oppressed discriminated and NIKE makes an effort to battle these gender barriers for women through this campaign.</p>

            <h1>Current <span>Progress?</span></h1>
            <p>This advocacy was a great success for NIKE as it was incredibly diverse and destroyed many stereotypes. Some of their many achievements and efforts include launching 3 films in the Middle East, Russia, and Turkey.
                They interviewed 90 women from those 3 countries and used their inspiring stories as foundation for the campaign.
                <br>
                <br>For the MIDDLE EAST, the question of resolute lingers: <span>"What will they say about you?"</span>
                <br>
                <br>For RUSSIA, everyone shall embrace the popular song: <span>"What are Girls Made of?"</span>
                <br>
                <br>Finally, for TURKEY, lay your eyes on the inspiring 60-second film: <span>"This is us."</span>
